## Hi, I’m Ark Sharma 👋

I’m a student focused on **Data Structures & Algorithms** and preparing for **software engineering placements**.  
Currently strengthening problem-solving skills and gradually learning **system design fundamentals**.

---

### 🎯 Current Focus
- Consistent DSA practice (arrays, strings, recursion, trees)
- Improving problem-solving speed & clarity
- Building a strong foundation for system design

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Core CS:** Data Structures & Algorithms  
- **Next:** System Design (basics → scalable systems)

---

### 📌 Projects
_Work in progress._  
I’m currently focused on DSA. Projects will be added as I start building alongside preparation.

---

### 📈 Coding Practice
- Regular LeetCode practice (patterns & fundamentals)
- Emphasis on clean logic over shortcuts

---

### 📜 Certifications
- Placeholder (relevant certifications will be added)
